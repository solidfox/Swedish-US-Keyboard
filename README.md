# Swedish - US-Keyboard

A keyboard layout to simplify using Swedish `å``ä``ö``Å``Ä``Ö` characters with a standard US keyboard. The `å``ä``ö` keys are put in their normal position on the `[``'``;` keys and the US keys can be reached using the option key.

## Installation
1. Download the .pkg file from the [latest release](https://github.com/solidfox/Swedish-US-Keyboard/releases/latest).
2. Run the installer.
3. Restart System Preferences if it was open during installation.
4. Go to `System Preferences > Keyboard > Input Sources` and add the Swedish > Swedish US input source.
5. If you have several sources make sure "Show Input menu in menu bar" is checked and switch to the Swedish US from the menu bar item.

## Usage
The layout works as a normal US layout with the exception of the ['; keys being replaced by åäö. You can get at the ['; characters by holding the option key while typing them. For consistency ] is also unchanged when holding the option key, so you can type [] without releasing option for the ] character.
