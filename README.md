# Swedish - US - Keyboard

A keyboard layout to simplify using Swedish `å` `ä` `ö` `Å` `Ä` `Ö` characters with a standard US keyboard. The `å` `ä` `ö` keys are put in their normal position on the `[` `'` `;` keys and the US keys can be reached using the option key.

## Installation
1. Download the .pkg file from the [latest release](https://github.com/solidfox/Swedish-US-Keyboard/releases/latest).
2. Run the installer. (May require right-clicking and selecting open to get past non-codesigned package dialog.)
3. Quit and relaunch `System Preferences` if it was open during installation.
4. Go to `System Preferences > Keyboard > Input Sources` and add the `Swedish > Swedish US` input source.
5. If you have several sources make sure `Show Input menu in menu bar` is checked and switch to the Swedish US from the menu bar item.

## Usage
The layout works as a normal US layout with the exception of the `[` `'` `;` keys being replaced by `å` `ä` `ö`. You can get the `[` `'` `;` characters by holding the option key while typing them. For consistency `]` is also unchanged when holding the option key, so you can type `[` `]` without releasing option for the `]` character.
